<p><strong>Payoff Rules:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>If your bid is lower than your opponent’s, you earn <strong>0 points</strong>.</li>
    <li>If your bid is higher, you earn: <strong>valuation − opponent’s bid</strong>.</li>
    <li>If bids are equal, you earn: <strong>(valuation − opponent’s bid) / 2</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>You have <strong>1 minute</strong> to submit your bid each round. If you do not submit a bid in time, you will earn 0 points.</p>
