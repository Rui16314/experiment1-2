<h3>Session 2: Repeated First-Price Sealed Bid Auction</h3>
<p>You will be randomly paired with one participant at the beginning of this session and remain paired with them for all 10 rounds.</p>

<p><strong>Payoff Rules:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>If your bid is lower than your opponent’s, you earn 0 points.</li>
    <li>If your bid is higher, you earn: <strong>valuation − bid</strong>.</li>
    <li>If bids are equal, you earn: <strong>(valuation − bid) / 2</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You have 1 minute to submit your bid each round.</p>
