<h3>Session 2: Repeated First-Price Sealed Bid Auction</h3>

<p>You will be randomly paired with one participant at the beginning of this session and remain paired with them for all 10 rounds.</p>

<p>Your valuation will be randomly assigned at the start and remain constant throughout the session. It will be between <strong>0.10 and 1.00</strong>.</p>

<p>You and your opponent will submit bids without knowing each other's valuation or bid.</p>

<p><strong>Payoff Rules:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>If your bid is lower than your opponent’s, you earn <strong>0 points</strong>.</li>
    <li>If your bid is higher, you earn: <strong>valuation − bid</strong>.</li>
    <li>If bids are equal, you earn: <strong>(valuation − bid) / 2</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>You have <strong>1 minute</strong> to submit your bid each round. If you do not submit a bid in time, you will earn 0 points.</p>
